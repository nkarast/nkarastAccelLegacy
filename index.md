## Welcome to my "Legacy" Page

This [website](https://nkarast.github.io/nkarastAccelLegacy/) is meant to be used as a sink for code snippets I had developed during my years in the CERN ABP/HSI group. I hope that it will prove helpful to future colleagues in a more practical level.

## Contents

- EOS Project : [LHC Beam-Beam](eos_project/eos_project.md) : A project space used for our tracking outputs
- Code snippets for Multi-Parametric DA scans
- Code snippets for lifetime analysis
- Code snippets for emittance analysis
- Code snippets for luminosity calculation 







## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nkarast/nkarastAccelLegacy/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nkarast/nkarastAccelLegacy/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
