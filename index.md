*"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants"*

No, no, no, don't get me wrong! Although a husky fellow, I don't consider myself a giant. Welcome to this [website](https://nkarast.github.io/nkarastAccelLegacy/) which is meant to be my little sandbox of code snippets that I developed during my years in the CERN ABP/HSI group. I hope that it will prove helpful to future colleagues in a more practical level. You can use the menu to the right top to navigate or the links below. There is also a search option in case you are in a hurry.
